## Bio

Vered Shwartz is a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Previously, she completed her PhD in Computer Science from Bar-Ilan University, under the supervision of Prof. Ido Dagan. Her research interests include commonsense reasoning, lexical and compositional semantics.

## Abstract

Natural language understanding models are trained on a sample of the real-world situations they may encounter. Commonsense and world knowledge, language, and reasoning skills can help them address unknown situations sensibly.Â  In this talk I will present two lines of work addressing commonsense knowledge and reasoning in natural language. I will first present a method for discovering relevant knowledge which is unstated but may be required for solving a particular problem, e.g., to correctly resolve "Children need to eat more vegetables because they [children / vegetables] are healthy" one needs to know that "vegetables are healthy". Such knowledge is discovered through a process of asking information seeking clarification questions (e.g. "what is the purpose of vegetables?") and answering them ("to provide nutrients"). I will then discuss nonmonotonic reasoning in natural language, a core human reasoning ability that has been studied in classical AI but mostly overlooked in modern NLP. I will talk about several recent papers addressing abductive reasoning (reasoning about plausible explanations), counterfactual reasoning (what if?) and defeasible reasoning (updating beliefs given additional information). Finally, I will discuss open problems in language, knowledge, and reasoning.
