Machine Learning and Friends Lunch is a lively and interactive forum held weekly where friends of the UMass Amherst machine learning community gather for a 50-minute presentation on recent machine learning research.

See this semester's schedule [here](/schedule). Previous semesters' talks (including some videos) are in our [archive](/archive).


## Details
MLFL is held on Thursdays from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm (unless otherwise noted) in CS 150 (in the computer science building). Pizza is available starting at 11:45 am. Everyone is welcome.

This semester, MLFL has been graciously sponsored by our friends at Oracle Labs.
