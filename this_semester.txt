{"data": [{"": "", "website": "", "title": "Probabilistic Latent Variable Modeling for Predicting Future Well-Being and Assessing Behavioral Influences on Stress", "abstract": "Health research has an increasing focus on promoting well-being and positive mental health, to prevent disease and to more effectively treat disorders. The availability of rich multi-modal datasets and advances in machine learning methods are now enabling data science research to begin to objectively assess well-being. However, most existing studies focus on detecting the current state or predicting the future state of well-being using stand-alone health behaviors. There is a need for methods that can handle a complex combination of health behaviors, as arise in real-world data. Building on our previous work where we predict future well-being, in this talk, I'll present a framework to 1) map multi-modal messy data collected in the \"wild\" to meaningful feature representations of health behavior, 2) uncover latent patterns comprising multiple health behaviors that best predict well-being, and 3) propose how these patterns may be used to recommend healthy behaviors to participants. We show how to use supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) to model the observed behaviors, and we apply variational inference to uncover the latent patterns. Implementing and evaluating the model on 5,397 days of data from a group of 244 college students, we find that these latent patterns are indeed predictive of self-reported stress, one of the largest components affecting well-being. We investigate the modifiable behaviors present in these patterns and uncover some ways in which the factors work together to influence well-being. This work contributes a new method using objective data analysis to help individuals monitor their well-being using real-world measurements. Insights from this study advance scientific knowledge on how combinations of daily modifiable human behaviors relate to human well-being.", "affiliation": "Microsoft NERD", "semester": "Fall", "speaker": "Ehiwemna Nosakhare", "sponsor": "Oracle Labs", "bio": "Ehi Nosakhare is an AI Data Scientist at Microsoft's New England Research and Development Center (NERD).

People prefer expressing information in natural language, and hence text corpora, such as Wikipedia, contain more detailed up-to-date information. This raises the question -- can we directly treat text corpora as knowledge bases for extracting information on demand? In this talk I will focus on two problems related to this question. First, I will look at augmenting incomplete KBs with textual knowledge for question answering. I will describe a graph neural network model for processing heterogeneous data from the two sources. Next, I will describe a scalable approach for compositional reasoning over the contents of the text corpus, analogous to following a path of relations in a structured KB to answer multi-hop queries. I will conclude by discussing interesting future research directions in this domain.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "semester": "Fall", "speaker": "Bhuwan Dhingra", "sponsor": "Oracle Labs", "bio": "Bhuwan Dhingra is a final year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by William Cohen and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
