In this talk, I will give an overview of our research works on understanding 3D object properties from 2D image collections and videos. Annotating several of the 3D object properties such as 3D shape, material properties, etc. is very labor-intensive and can not easily scale to large-scale datasets and new object categories. So, techniques that can estimate these object properties with minimal supervision are important for practical purposes.   In the first part of the talk, I will present an overview of our research works that can simultaneously learn object shape and material properties i.e., estimating re-lightable 3D assets from an image collection of an object that is captured under unconstrained variable lighting environments. In the second part, I will present techniques to estimate articulated 3D object shape given a single monocular video of a moving object. These works are category-agnostic and only assume a weak form of 2D supervision (object segmentations), thereby providing important steps towards practical 3D object understanding from the 2D world imagery.

We propose a meta-framework for this problem, inspired by the recent success of highly parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning. Our experiments show that differentially private adaptations of these approaches outperform previous private algorithms in three important dimensions: utility, privacy, and the computational and memory cost of private training. On many commonly studied datasets, the utility of private models approaches that of non-private models. For example, on the MNLI dataset we achieve an accuracy of 87.8% using RoBERTa-Large and 83.5% using RoBERTa-Base with a privacy budget of \u03f5=6.7. In comparison, absent privacy constraints, RoBERTa-Large achieves an accuracy of 90.2%. Our findings are similar for natural language generation tasks. Privately fine-tuning with DART, GPT-2-Small, GPT-2-Medium, GPT-2-Large, and GPT-2-XL achieve BLEU scores of 38.5, 42.0, 43.1, and 43.8 respectively (privacy budget of \u03f5=6.8,\u03b4= 1e-5) whereas the non-private baseline is 48.1. All our experiments suggest that larger models are better suited for private fine-tuning: while they are well known to achieve superior accuracy non-privately, we find that they also better maintain their accuracy when privacy is introduced.   No knowledge of differential privacy will be assumed. Based on joint work with Da Yu, Saurabh Naik, Arturs Backurs, Sivakanth Gopi, Huseyin A.
