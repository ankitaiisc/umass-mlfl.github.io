In this talk, I will give an overview of our research works on understanding 3D object properties from 2D image collections and videos. Annotating several of the 3D object properties such as 3D shape, material properties, etc. is very labor-intensive and can not easily scale to large-scale datasets and new object categories. So, techniques that can estimate these object properties with minimal supervision are important for practical purposes.   In the first part of the talk, I will present an overview of our research works that can simultaneously learn object shape and material properties i.e., estimating re-lightable 3D assets from an image collection of an object that is captured under unconstrained variable lighting environments. In the second part, I will present techniques to estimate articulated 3D object shape given a single monocular video of a moving object. These works are category-agnostic and only assume a weak form of 2D supervision (object segmentations), thereby providing important steps towards practical 3D object understanding from the 2D world imagery.
